/**
 * Thin adapter around the LINE Push API used by the weekly-push
 * worker (Task #23).
 *
 * The legacy `server/line-notify.ts` already owns the cron-triggered
 * push code and an internal `sendLinePushMessage` helper. We do NOT
 * want to rewrite or expose that file's internals, so this adapter
 * re-implements the same minimal POST so the worker has its own
 * boundary for testing and error mapping.

/**
 * Sends a single text push message to a LINE user/group ID.
 * Never throws — callers branch on `ok` so the worker can record
 * structured failure info on the recipient row.
 *
 * Errors come from `fetchWithTimeout` and are pre-classified:
 *   `timeout` | `network` | `http_4xx` | `http_5xx` | `no_token`.
 * The weekly-push worker uses these to decide retry vs. final-fail
 * (Task #32: 4xx other than 429 is treated as a hard error and is
 * not retried, since LINE 4xx responses won't change on retry).
